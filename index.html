            I am a computer scientist with the Air Force Research Lab's
            Information Directorate. I research artificial intelligence and machine learning 
            with an emphasis on collective and emergent beahviors, multi-agent teaming and task allocation, 
            and ad hoc teaming.

            I completed my master's degree at Brigham Young University in Computer Science in 2013 
            and graduated with honors with a Bachelor's degree also from Brigham Young University in Mathematics in 2011.                  
            
        </p>
        <p>
            Since graduating I have been employed at AFRL, but will soon be pursuing a PhD at UT Austin!
